                <p>I work on messaging tools at Hudl. You can read more on the process of creating those tools <a href="messaging.html">here</a>.</p><br />

                <p>During the user research process, I discovered that the typography in the Hudl iOS app hindered the users’ experience because it was too small to read. Observing our users in-person helped me understand that our users need flexible typography. This insight helped me form two guidelines for Hudl's mobile UI.</p><br />

                <p>Our team visited a high school basketball coach to observe how he used Hudl. He’s an active user of the Hudl product - looking at his metrics alone, one might think that he doesn’t have any issues using our product. However, the trip revealed that we weren't appropriately displaying typography in the app.</p><br />

                <p>Let’s compare the following two screens: On the left is a sample screen from the iOS app. Clearly, the UI deviates from the iOS Human Interface guidelines in two ways:</p><br />

                <div class="post-image">
                  <img src="../images/work/accessibility_compare.png"><br /><br />
                </div>

                <ol>
                  <li>The font size is too small and the line height is too tight</li>
                  <li>The color of the text, especially the section headers, is too low contrast</li>
                </ol>

                <p>On the right is how this coach actually uses his device. When we looked at how this coach was reading his email, his font size was increased to the max.</p><br />

                <p>We weren’t taking advantage of iOS Dynamic Type, an OS-level feature that allows the user to make the font size larger or smaller. Our app didn't allow the coach to read text the way he wanted to!</p><br />

                <p>This anecdote was affirmed through several other on-site visits. Once we understood that a fair number of the coaches that were using the apps were older males that needed visual assistance, we knew we needed to alter the UI.</p><br />
              </td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <table class="portfolio-container u-full-width">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Guidelines</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>
                <p>The first change was to create a typographic hierachy and take advantage of iOS Dynamic Type. On the left is iOS (font: SF UI Text) and on the right is Android (font: Roboto).</p><br />

                <div class="post-image">
                  <img src="../images/work/accessibility_hierarchy.png"><br /><br />
                </div>

                <p>Even with a hierarchy, typography by itself isn’t enough. There still needs to be an underlying principle that unifies the way our apps look. The second change was to align the hierarchy to a unified baseline grid. The baseline grid is set at 4dp. It had to be an even number that was common enough to accommodate multiple screen densities.</p><br />

                <div class="post-image">
                  <img src="../images/work/accessibility_baseline.png"><br /><br />
                </div>

                <p>Put together, the result is an iOS app that is easier to read with a more consistent UI. Taking advantage of Dynamic Type allows the app to accommodate each user's visual needs.</p><br />

                <p>The following is a reference design used for the messaging feature. Each piece of the UI has been turned into a reusable component that is aligned to this 4pt grid.</p><br />

                  <img src="../images/work/accessibility_result.png"><br /><br />
