    <h1 class="f6 fw5 lh-title black-60 mt4 mb2 ttu relative">Background</h1>

    <p class="f5 fw4 lh-copy">I worked on Hudl's messaging features. You can read more about the process of creating Hudl Messaging <a class="link bb b--blue dim blue" href="messaging.html">here.</a></p>

    <p class="f5 fw4 lh-copy">During the user research process, I discovered that the typography in the Hudl iOS app hindered the users’ experience because it was too small to read. Observing our users in-person helped me understand that our users need flexible typography. This insight helped me form two guidelines for Hudl's mobile UI.</p>

    <h1 class="f6 fw5 lh-title black-60 mt4 mb2 ttu relative">What did I observe?</h1>

    <p class="f5 fw4 lh-copy">Our team visited a high school basketball coach to observe how he used Hudl. He’s an active user of the Hudl product - looking at his metrics alone, one might think that he doesn’t have any issues using our product. However, the trip revealed that we weren't appropriately displaying typography in the app.</p>

    <p class="f5 fw4 lh-copy">Let’s compare the following two screens: On the left is a sample screen from the iOS app. Clearly, the UI deviates from the iOS Human Interface guidelines in two ways:</p>

    <ul class="f5 fw4 pl4 lh-copy black mt0 mb3">
      <li>The font size is too small and the line height is too tight</li>
      <li>The color of the text, especially the section headers, is too low contrast</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="w-90 center">
      <img src="../images/work/accessibility_compare.png">
    </div>

    <p class="f5 fw4 lh-copy">On the right is how this coach actually uses his device. When we looked at how this coach was reading his email, his font size was increased to the max.</p>

    <p class="f5 fw4 lh-copy">We weren’t taking advantage of iOS Dynamic Type, an OS-level feature that allows the user to make the font size larger or smaller. Our app didn't allow the coach to read text the way he wanted to!</p>

    <p class="f5 fw4 lh-copy">This anecdote was affirmed through several other on-site visits. Once we understood that a fair number of the coaches that were using the apps were older males that needed visual assistance, we knew we needed to alter the UI.</p>

    <h1 class="f6 fw5 lh-title black-60 mt4 mb2 ttu relative">Guidelines</h1>

    <p class="f5 fw4 lh-copy">The first change was to create a typographic hierachy and take advantage of iOS Dynamic Type. On the left is iOS (font: SF UI Text) and on the right is Android (font: Roboto).</p>

    <div class="w-90 center">
      <img src="../images/work/accessibility_hierarchy.png">
    </div>

    <p class="f5 fw4 lh-copy">Even with a hierarchy, typography by itself isn’t enough. There still needs to be an underlying principle that unifies the way our apps look. The second change was to align the hierarchy to a unified baseline grid. The baseline grid is set at 4dp. It had to be an even number that was common enough to accommodate multiple screen densities.</p>

    <div class="w-90 center">
      <img src="../images/work/accessibility_baseline.png">
    </div>

    <p class="f5 fw4 lh-copy">Put together, the result is an iOS app that is easier to read with a more consistent UI. Taking advantage of Dynamic Type allows the app to accommodate each user's visual needs.</p>

    <p class="f5 fw4 lh-copy">The following is a reference design used for the messaging feature. Each piece of the UI has been turned into a reusable component that is aligned to this 4pt grid.</p>
